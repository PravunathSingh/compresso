## Compresso: Image Compression for the Web demystified.

Compresso is a webapp created to help you understand how image compression works. It allows you to upload an image and see how it is compressed using different approaches. It also allows you to see the effect of different compression parameters on the image quality.

The approaches demonstrated are mainly divided into 3 categories:

- Client Side Compression
- Server Side Compression
- Compression directly on the cloud storage

Each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages. The goal of this app is to help you understand the tradeoffs involved in each approach and help you make an informed decision.

Furthermore each of the above approaches can be further divided based on what tools and techniques are being used. For example, the client side compression can be done using the HTML5 canvas API or using a library like [Compressorjs](https://fengyuanchen.github.io/compressorjs/). Similarly, the server side compression can be done using a library like [Sharp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp) or using a service like [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/).
